MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. It represent users' reviews of movies.
 
This data set consists of:
	* 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
	* Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
        * Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)


u.data     -- The full u data set, 100000 ratings by 943 users on 1682 items.
              Each user has rated at least 20 movies.  Users and items are
              numbered consecutively from 1.  The data is randomly
              ordered. This is a tab separated list of 
	         user id | item id | rating | timestamp. 
              The time stamps are unix seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC   

u.user     -- Demographic information about the users; this is a tab
              separated list of
              user id | age | gender | occupation | zip code
              The user ids are the ones used in the u.data data set.



Tasks to be performed
=====================

Setting Up

First, you need to set up the data in Hadoop.

    create table 'u_data' based on the schema of the file 'u.data'
    import file 'u.data' to table 'u_data'
    Do a simple query or two to check if everything is OK (for example Body Snatchers is movie 573 and it has 33 reviews) 

    create table 'u_user' based on the schema of the file 'u.user'
    import file 'u.user' to table 'u_user'
    Do a simple query or two to check if everything is OK


Queries to be performed
=======================

1. create a u_data table

2. see the field descriptions of u_data table

3. load data into u_data table from a local text file

4. show all the data in the newly created u_data table

5. show the numbers of item reviewed by each user in the newly created u_data table

6. show the numbers of users reviewed each item in the newly created u_data table

7. create a u_user table

8. see the field descriptions of u_user table

9. load data into u_user table from a local text file

10. show all the data in the newly created user table

11. count the number of data in the u_user table

12. count the number of data in the u_user table

13. count the number of user in the u_user table genderwise

14. join u_data table and u_user tables based on userid and show the top 10 results
